# Welcome to the Unity Tech Test at East Side Games!

We appreciate that we had the chance to get to know you better in our first interview and are now curious to see your skills as a Software Engineer in action! This test is meant to assess your technical skills, but in a creative manner with a real project. This is your chance to show us not only your knowledge but how you apply that knowledge to a real world problem.

If at any time you have questions or something is unclear, please email us. 

## Your Task

**You have been given a Rock Paper Scissors game prototype. Add features of your choice, restructure, refactor and fix any bugs! Change whatever you want. Do what you think is the best representation of your skillset but please do not focus on the UI.**

We encourage you to take notes, either digitally or on paper. Use these to track features or tasks you would like to do but do not have time to implement. Please send us these notes along with your finished work.

* Use any online resource for help, including Unity documentation and C#. 
* Your work should be your original work and not copy/paste examples from Stackoverflow or other online resources.
* If you end up using *any* third part code, this must be clearly stated in a comment with source. 

## Deliverables

* Email back the updated project either in a new zip file or include a github repo link.
* Include in your finished project any notes you may have.
* In the body of your email, please explain the areas you focused on, improvements you've made, and any other information you feel is valuable.

# Good luck!
